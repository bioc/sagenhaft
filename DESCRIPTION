Description: This package implements several functions useful for
        analysis of gene expression data by sequencing tags as done in
	SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expressen) data,
        i.e. extraction of a SAGE library from sequence files,
        sequence error correction, library comparison. Sequencing error 
	correction is implementing using an Expectation Maximization Algorithm
	based on a Mixture Model of tag counts.
